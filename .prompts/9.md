In the last prompt I wasn't thinking clearly (tired and on a train).

The code in handler.go that is concernered with ensuring the sqlite database is setup shouldn't be in handler. 

It should be in the main.go file.

Can you move the db setup code from handler into main, along with all test associated test cases?
