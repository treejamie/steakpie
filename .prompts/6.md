In this prompt we want to focus on the user experierence.

First of all provide instructions to run the binary in the readme. Keep the instructions precise.

THen I want to have the binary explain clear error messages if required env vars are not present.

The goal is to make a very joyful experience where error states are clearly explained to allow for fast recovery that makes people feel good about using the tool.

You should write tests to ensure that the binary only starts when all factors are present. You don't need to worry about ensuring that it runs when everything is present, just make sure it doesn't run until all env vars are present.
