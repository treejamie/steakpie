You are on a new branch.

In this branch you are to create a function that is called from `Hander` that ensures the webhook signature matches the payload.

This function should be called after the `r.Method != http.MethodPost` check.

If the check fails, return HTTP 403.

Write a test to validate happy path and sad path.
