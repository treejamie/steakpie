In this prompt we're going to do config.

When a payload is received, we need to know what container name is to update what docker process. To do that we're going to need to have a local config file.

The config file will be the second argument given to run the application name. 

We will use YAML for the config file and for a first pass the config file will look like this

```yaml

jamiec:
  - docker compose up
  - echo "webhook received and docker compose restarted

```

where "jamiec" comes from the start of the json file under the following key

```json
{
  "action": "published",
  "registry_package": {
    "id": 10354675,
    "name": "jamiec",
    "rest_of_json": "I terminated the JSON here , there was loads more but I wanted this to be valid JSON"
  }
}
```

The idea is that when a given webhook is received for a CONTAINER event a bunch of commands are issued to restart processes.

The application should not start up if there's no config present and it should give clear instructions about requiring a config file.

YOu should write a series of tests to ensure the config file is valid and meets the above specification.
