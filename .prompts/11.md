In this work we're going to change the format of the config. I realised the failed commands were also due to not exec'ing things in the right directory.

The structure of the config file will change to be as below



```yaml
jamiec:  # this is the same - name of repo
  run:  # this is new "run" is static string, consider it domain language.
    /foo/bar:  # this is the directory we're going to cd'into
      - - echo "yay" # same - command
        - echo "nested" # same - nested command
      - cat foo.txt # same parallel command
    /another/dir:  # new, cd into another dir
      - ls -al # same run a command

```

We now have a new mapping key "run". There may be others later such as `set_up` and `teardown`, but they are future things, not for today.

The run sequence has mappings which are directory paths, each mapping has sequences of commands, some nested some parallel.

Please adjust the codebase to work on the above config. It does not need to be backwards compatible.

Ensure all tests pass and write new tests to support the new structure - IF AND ONLY IF - the existing tests don't provider coverage of that logical side of the config
