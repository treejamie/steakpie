Github may send webhooks multiple times. 

Each webhook has a `X-GitHub-Delivery` header and that should be used to ensure we're processing an event once. We need to be idempotent.

To do this we're going to create an sqlite database (using the package https://gitlab.com/cznic/sqlite) of the hooks we've processed. As an id we'll use the `X-GitHub-Delivery` header which is a globally unique identifier (GUID).

The schema of the sqlite database should look like this

```
table events:
  id: uuid (unique index)
  timestamp: datetime
  repository: string
```

Where id is X-GitHub-Delivery, timestamp is now() and respository is from the "name" value from the webhook.  As an example, here's a sample of the webhook so you can see where to find the value for name.


```
{
  "action": "published",
  "registry_package": {
    "id": 10354675,
    "name": "jamiec",
    "rest_of_json": "I terminated the JSON here , there was loads more but I wanted this to be valid JSON"
  }
}
```


In the handler file I've left a comment `// ensure the sqlite database is setup and if not set it up` after this insert code to ensure the sqlite database is setup correctly. The database should be called "db.sqlite"


For every incoming request, record the id, timestamp and repository into the sqlite database for the event.  There will be multiple occurances of events sent and it's our responsibility to be idempotant. 

If an event comes in we attempt to insert the row of data (id, timestamp, repository). If there's no error then I want you to log "event is new, proceeed to dispatch" and if there's an error due to a violation on the unique index, I want you to log "Duplicate webhook"

I want you to write tests to validate the functionality described in this file.
