Read Agents.MD it's been a while.

In this PR we want to start exec'ing commands in reponse to receiving a webhook.

Based on the config we have structures that contain repositories mixed with a hierarchy of commands.

here's the two supported methods of running commands.

## Example 1 - nested

```
jamiec_ts:
  - docker compose pull
    - doppler run -- docker compose up -d
```

In the above example steakpie activates when a webhook is received for the jamiec_ts repository. There's two commands and they're nested. First `docker compose pull` is ran and if it successfull then it runs `doppler run -- docker compose up -d`.  Should the first command fail, the second command isn't attempted. 

## Example 2 - paralell
```
foobar:
  - docker compose pull
  - doppler run -- docker compose up -d
```

In the above example steakpie activates when a webhook is received for the foobar repository. There's two commands and they're parallel. First `docker compose pull` is ran and regardless of whether or not it succeeds, the second command is run `doppler run -- docker compose up -d`.

## Logging

In both of the above examples, when a command succeeds or fails, we always log. All output from the exec'd command should also be logged so debugging is as pleasurable as can be.

An example of how nested commands would log is below for a happy path:

If a command fails, log all output. There's no need to give an example of how to log nested commands, I'm sure you get it.


## Plan

This is complex work. It should be planned and tests should be written. If you need a config with imaginary commands, stick to basic unix tools such as "echo" etc.
