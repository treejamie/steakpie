In this work I want you to set up a dockerfile so this can be run via docker & docker compose.

One of the aims of this codebase is that other people can find it useful. Rather than mess around with writing 1000 serviced type scripts I think that a nice, minimal, maybe distroless dockerfile could be the way to run this on a machine so that people can experiement for themselves.

The dockerfile should be very minimal and essential contain only the binary.
